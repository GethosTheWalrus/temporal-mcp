# Contributing to temporal-mcp

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This document covers everything you need to get started.

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GethosTheWalrus/temporal-mcp.git
cd temporal-mcp

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

pip install -e .
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

## Running Tests

```bash
pytest tests/ -v
```

## Code Quality

This project enforces linting, type checking, and formatting via pre-commit hooks. They run automatically on `git commit` once installed. You can also run them manually:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

Individual tools:

```bash
flake8 temporal_mcp/   # linting
mypy temporal_mcp/     # type checking
black temporal_mcp/    # formatting
```

## Submitting a Pull Request

1. Fork the repo and create a branch from `main`
2. Make your changes, including tests for any new behaviour
3. Ensure all checks pass (`pytest`, `flake8`, `mypy`, `black`)
4. Open a PR against `main`

## Commit Message Convention

This project uses [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) and [python-semantic-release](https://python-semantic-release.readthedocs.io/) for automated versioning. **Your commit messages directly determine the next version number**, so please follow the format:

| Prefix | When to use | Version bump |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| `fix:` | A bug fix | Patch (`0.2.0` → `0.2.1`) |
| `feat:` | A new feature | Minor (`0.2.0` → `0.3.0`) |
| `feat!:` or `BREAKING CHANGE:` in footer | A breaking API change | Major (`0.2.0` → `1.0.0`) |
| `chore:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `ci:`, `refactor:` | Everything else | No bump |

Examples:

```
feat: add support for API key authentication
fix: handle missing TLS cert gracefully
feat!: rename TEMPORAL_HOST env var to TEMPORAL_ADDRESS

BREAKING CHANGE: TEMPORAL_HOST has been renamed to TEMPORAL_ADDRESS
```

Commits that don't follow this format won't break anything, but they won't trigger a release either.

## Releasing

Releases are fully automated. On every merge to `main`:

1. `python-semantic-release` inspects commits since the last tag, bumps the version in `pyproject.toml`, and pushes a `vX.Y.Z` tag
2. The publish workflow triggers on that tag and uploads the new version to PyPI

There is nothing to do manually.
